            <h2>What is VPOP?</h2>
            <p>
                VPOP is a grassroots organization advocating for more livable, lively, and resilient cities in Vermont. We believe that first and foremost, <b>Cities are for People</b>, and aim to analyze the current shortcomings and future needs of our cities through that lens.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Our mission is to organize the community outreach and local policy advocacy needed to make our cities more affordable, safe, and vibrant for everyone.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, this can look like pushing for diverse and robust active transportation and public transit systems, or campaigning for zoning changes that legalize dynamic, human-scale, mixed-use neighborhoods... all the while explaining how these changes positively impact our affordability crisis and our looming climate goals.
            </p>
